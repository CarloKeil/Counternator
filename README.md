# Counternator
Javascript scroll-activated counter.

Make sure to use this: <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js"></script>

And this for more easing options: <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-easing/1.3/jquery.easing.min.js"></script>

Default Counter:
<span class="revealOnScroll" countto="500" counterduration="3000" countereasing="linear" counterdelay="500">0</span>

revealOnScroll class is required. Attributes can be edited.

The value in between the tags determines the starting value. 
Use countto to select end value (integer value), 
counterduration to select duration (integer value), 
countereasing to select easing type (text value) 
and counterdelay to select delay before counter starts (integer value)

Thanks, and have fun!
