# Counternator
Javascript scroll-activated counter.

Borrowed code from these CodePens:
http://codepen.io/benske/pen/yJoqz
http://codepen.io/shivasurya/pen/FatiB


Make sure to use JQuery! "https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js"

And this for more easing options. "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-easing/1.3/jquery.easing.min.js"

Default Counter Attributes: class="revealOnScroll" countto="500" counterduration="3000" countereasing="linear" counterdelay="500"

revealOnScroll class is required. Attributes can be edited.

The value in between your revealOnScroll tag determines the starting value. 
Use countto to select end value (integer value), 
counterduration to select duration (integer value), 
countereasing to select easing type (text value) 
and counterdelay to select delay before counter starts (integer value)

Thanks, and have fun!
